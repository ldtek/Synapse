one idea of what to add in new version: 
my idea: Better compression rate so that the out put of the compression would be better: 
what can you do: to commit your code please make a new file in this folder and add your idea to that, you can also add the code in that 
file, but it is optional.
or you can add your code to the 'code folder'
